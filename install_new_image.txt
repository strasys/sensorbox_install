How to use the script to flash the eMMC

    Write a bootable image to an SD card: using a tool like Etcher. 

Edit the /boot/uEnv.txt file: on the SD card's Linux partition. 
Find the line: cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh and remove the # at the beginning of the line to uncomment it. 
Save the file: and insert the SD card into your BeagleBone Black. 
Power on: the board while holding the user boot button (S2). 
Release the button when the user LEDs start to flash in a sequential pattern. 
Wait for the flashing process to complete, which is indicated when the board shuts itself off. 
Remove the SD card and restart the board to boot from the newly flashed eMMC.
